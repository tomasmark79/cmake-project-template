## CMake C++ Project Template

This project template was inspired by various projects encountered in the past. The goal is to keep it as simple as possible while using GTest for testing.

## Dependencies

- GTest is downloaded automatically via CMake's FetchContent.
- cmake
- git

## Platform Independence

Created and tested on Linux, but it may work in other environments.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomasmark79/cmake-project-template.git
cd cmake-project-template
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
cd ../install/
ls -la
```
