## CMake C++ Project Template

This project template was inspired by various projects encountered in the past. The goal is to keep it as simple as possible while using GTest for testing.

## Dependencies

- GTest is downloaded via CMake's FetchContent
- cmake
- git

## Platform Independence

Created and tested on Linux, but it may work in other environments.

## Usage

notice:
    If you want to use VSCode IDE and you already used commands bellow to configure and compile project, just remove build folder and reconfigure your project via CMake extension in VSCode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomasmark79/cmake-project-template.git
cd cmake-project-template
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
cd ../install/
ls -la
```
